## Statistical models for time series

So far, we have worked with time series as a fixed sequence of numbers.
A *time series model* treats the sequence of observations as a realization of a sequence random variables $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ and specifies their joint distribution.
$$
\P\lbrace X_1 \leq x_1, X_2 \leq x_2,\ldots,X_n \leq x_n\rbrace.
$$
Such a sequence of random variables is also called a *stochastic process*.[^1]
We will typically use upper case $(X_t)$ to denote the stochastic process, and lower case $(x_t)$ to denote a single realization.
Note that in general, $X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_n$ are not independent, nor do they even have the same marginal distribution.
To simplify notation, we will use $x_{1:n}$ to denote $x_1,\ldots,x_n$ and $X_{1:n}$ to denote $X_1,\ldots,X_n$.

**Mean and autocovariance functions:**
We often study random variables via their moments (mean, variance, etc.).
For stochastic processes, these now become functions.
More precisely, the *mean function* of a stochastic process $(X_t)$ is defined via
$$
\mu_X(t) \coloneqq \E\lbrace X_t \rbrace.
$$
The *autocovariance function* (ACVF) is defined via
$$
\gamma_X(s, t) \coloneqq \Cov\lbrace X_s, X_t\rbrace.
$$

[^1]: In the setting of time series models, we will use the terms "stochastic process" and "time series" interchangeably.

## Stationary stochastic processes

In other areas of statistics, such as linear regression, one estimates the parameters of the distribution $p$ from *repeated independent measurements* and then uses it to make predictions for future observations.
Unfortunately, in time series problems, we typically see only a *single realization* of the stochastic process.
Hence, in order to estimate model parameters, we have to make further assumptions on the stochastic process, such as that it satisfies some sort of regularity over time.
This can be formalized using a concept called stationarity.

**Strict stationarity:** 
A *strictly (or strongly) stationary* stochastic process $(X_t)$ is one for which all finite-dimensional marginals of the joint distribution are shift invariant, i.e. that
$$
\P\lbrace X_{t_1} \leq x_1, X_{t_2} \leq x_2,\ldots,X_{t_k} \leq x_k \rbrace = \P\lbrace X_{t_1+ h} \leq x_1, X_{t_2 + h} \leq x_2,\ldots,X_{t_k + h} \leq x_n\rbrace
$$
for any dimension $k$, time indices $t_1,t_2,\ldots, t_k$, and shift $h$.

This definition is often too strong and diffuclt to assess.
Hence, it is common to impose a milder conditions based on the first two moments.

**Weak stationarity:**
A weakly stationary stochastic process is one for which

1. $\mu_X(t)$ exists and is independent of $t$, and
2. $\gamma_X(t, t+h)$ exists for every $t$ and $h$ and is independent of $t$.

Henceforth, we will use the term "stationary" to mean weakly stationary.[^2]
For such a stochastic process, we will slightly abuse notation, denoting its mean by $\mu_X$, and its autocovariance function by
$$
\gamma_X(h) = \gamma_X(t, t + h).
$$

[^2]: As a slight variant of this, we call a stochastic process *covariance stationary* if 2 holds, but with no requirement on the mean function.

**Autocorrelation function:**
The *autocorrelation function (ACF)* of a stationary process $(X_t)$ is defined as
$$
\rho_X(h) = \frac{\gamma(h)}{\gamma(0)}.
$$
One can check that this indeed defines the correlation between $X_t$ and $X_{t+h}$ for any $t$, and satisfies $- 1 \leq \rho_X(h) \leq 1$.
Note also that this function is even, i.e. $\rho_X(-h) = \rho_X(h)$, and positive semidefinite.


**Multiple processes:**
Given two stochastic proccesses $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$, their *cross-covariance function* is defined as
$$
\gamma_{XY}(s, t) \coloneqq \Cov\lbrace X_s, Y_t\rbrace.
$$
If $(X_t)$ and $(Y_t)$ are each stationary, and $\gamma_{XY}(h) \coloneqq \gamma_{XY}(t+h, t)$ is independent on $t$, we say that they are (weakly) *jointly stationary*.
In this case, we define their *cross-correlation function (CCF)* as
$$
\rho_{XY}(h) = \frac{\gamma_{XY}(h)}{\sqrt{\gamma_X(0)\gamma_Y(0)}}.
$$
Unlike the ACF, this function is not necessarily even or positive semidefinite.

## Examples

We now introduce some common examples of time series models.

### White noise

There are three types of white noise models.
We say that $(W_t)$ is a *weak white noise* process if it is weakly stationary, with
$\mu_X = 0$ and
$$
\gamma_X(h) = \begin{cases}
\sigma^2 & \text{if}~h = 0, \\
0 & \text{otherwise}.
\end{cases}
$$ {#eq-stationary-wn-acvf}
We say that it is a *strong white noise* process if, in addition to the above, the sequence of random variables are independent and identically distributed.
Finally, we say that it is a *Gaussian white noise* process if the sequence of random variables are i.i.d. Gaussian.
By convention, these are all denoted using $WN(0,\sigma^2)$.

We will soon see that many time series models are built out of transformations of a white noise process.
Generally speaking, transformations of weak white noise give rise to weakly stationary processes, while transformations of strong white noise give rise to strongly stationary processes.
Transformations of Gaussian white noise processes are *Gaussian processes*.
Unless stated otherwise, however, we will assume in the rest of this book that we work with strong white noise.

### Random walk

We say that $(X_t)$ is a *random walk with drift* if we have
$$ 
X_t = \delta + X_{t-1} + W_t,
$$ {#eq-stationary-rw}
where $(W_t) \sim WN(0,\sigma^2)$.
$\delta$ is called the drift of the walk, and if $\delta = 0$, $(X_t)$ is called a *simple random walk*.
Note that a random walk is not stationary, even when there is no drift.
Indeed, assuming the initial condition $X_0 = 0$ and rewriting @eq-stationary-rw as
$$
X_t = t\delta + \sum_{j=1}^t W_j,
$$
we easily compute $\mu_X(t) = \delta t$ and
$$
\gamma_X(s, t) = \sigma^2\min\lbrace s, t\rbrace.
$$

Sample trajectories for two random walks with different drift values are shown in the following plot.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: Trajectories for a simple random walk (black) and a random walk with drift = 0.2. The dotted lines show have slope equal to 0 and 0.2 respectively and reflect the mean function for both processes.

                 linetype = "dashed", color = "black") + 
    scale_color_discrete(labels = c("0", "0.2"), type = c("black", "blue"))
```

### Signal plus noise {#sec-stationary-examples-signal-plus-noise}

A *signal in noise* model is of the form
$$
X_t = f_t + W_t,
$$
where $(f_t)$ is a deterministic sequence of values and $(W_t) \sim WN(0,\sigma^2)$.
Usually, $f_t$ has a simple functional form, such as a sinusoidal function.
Here, the first term is usually regarded as a signal, while the second term is regarded as measurement noise to be removed.
This can be done using smoothing techniques, or, if the functional form is known in advance, via simple linear regression onto a convenient function basis.
Note that this process is not stationary unless $f_t$ is constant.

- When $f_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t$, this time series model gives rise to the linear trend method.
- We can also view $f_t$ as a function of other known, concurrent time series which are treated as deterministic, i.e. $f_t = f(Z_{1t},Z_{2t},\ldots,Z_{rt})$.

### Linear process {#sec-stationary-linear}

A *linear process* is defined as a convolution between a white noise process and a sequence of coefficients, that is, it is obtained by applying a *linear filter* (see @sec-transformations).
Specifically, it is given by
$$
X_t = \mu + \sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j},
$$
where $(W_t) \sim WN(0,\sigma^2)$ and
$$
\sum_{j=^-\infty}^\infty |\psi_j| < \infty.
$$ {#eq-stationary-linear-l1}

The mean function is constant and satisfies $\mu_X = \mu$.
We next calculate its autocovariance as follows:
$$
\begin{split}
\gamma_{X}(h) & = \Cov\left\lbrace \sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty \psi_i W_{t + h-i}, \sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j W_{t-j} \right\rbrace \\
& = \sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_i \psi_j \Cov\lbrace W_{t+h-i}, W_{t-j}\rbrace \\
& = \sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_i \psi_j \gamma_W(j-i+h) \\
& = \sigma^2\sum_{i=-\infty}^\infty \psi_i \psi_{i-h}.
\end{split} 
$$ {#eq-stationary-linear-acvf}
Here, the second equality comes from the bilinear nature of covariance, while the last equality uses @eq-stationary-wn-acvf.
Finally, this value is finite because of @eq-stationary-linear-l1.
We thus see that $(X_t)$ is stationary.

We say that a linear process is *causal* if $\psi_j = 0$ for all $j < 0$.
In other words, for such a time series, the observation at time $t$ depends only on the current and past values of the white noise process.
This is an appropriate assumption when modeling real world time series.[^3]

[^3]: Indeed, linear processes have surprising generality.
The [Wold decomposition theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wold%27s_theorem) states that every covariance-stationary time series can be written as the sum of a linear process as well as a predictable sequence.

## Forecasting with simple models

We now describe how to use statistical models to do forecasting.
Recall that a statistical model is a probability distribution $\P$ on sequences $x_1,x_2,\ldots$.
For convenience, we will often write such a distribution as a density $p$.[^4]
Given observed values for the first $n$ terms in the sequence, $x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n$, the distributional forecast for $x_{n+h}$ is then the conditional distribution $p(x_{n+h}|x_{1:n})$, while the point forecast is defined as the mean of this distribution:
$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} \coloneqq \int x p(x|x_{1:n}) dx = \E\left\lbrace X_{n+h}|X_{1:n} = x_{1:n}\right\rbrace.
$$
Note that the conditional mean can be thought of as a function of the random variables, i.e.
$$
r(x_{1:n}) \coloneqq \E\lbrace X_{n+h}|X_1 = x_1,\ldots,X_n = x_n\rbrace.
$$
A key property is that the conditional mean is a [Bayes optimal predictors](https://stephens999.github.io/fiveMinuteStats/decision_theory_bayes_rule.html) with respect to squared loss, i.e. we have
$$
r = \textnormal{argmin}_{f \colon \R^n \to \R} \E\left\lbrace (f(X_{1:n}) - X_{n+h})^2\right\rbrace.
$$

[^4]: Time series models extend to non-continuous distributions that do not have densities. But we ignore this for now for notational convenience.

Let us see how to use this recipe to derive the simple forecasting methods from @sec-forecasting from statistical models.

### Mean method

Suppose we have the model $X_t = \theta + W_t$ for an unknown $\theta$ and a Gaussian white noise $(W_t) \sim WN(0,\sigma^2)$.
Since $W_{n+h}$ is independent of $W_{1:n}$ and has mean zero, the point forecast is
$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = \theta + \E\left\lbrace W_{n+h}|X_{1:n} = x_{1:n}\right\rbrace = \theta.
$$
To calculate our estimate of $\theta$, we can write the likelihood as
$$
p_\theta(x_{1:n}) \propto \exp\left(- \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t - \theta)^2 \right)
$$
Taking a logarithm gives
$$
\log p_\theta(x_{1:n}) = - \frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=1}^n (x_t - \theta)^2 + C.
$$
Hence, the MLE for $\theta$ is $\hat\theta = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^n x_t$, and we forecast
$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^n x_t,
$$
which is the formula for the mean method.

### Naive method

Assume the random walk model @eq-stationary-rw with $\delta = 0$.
We may recurse @eq-stationary-rw to get
$$
X_{n+h} = X_n + W_{n+1} + W_{n+2} + \cdots + W_{n+h}.
$$
This shows that

$$
p(x_{n+h}|X_{1:n}=x_{1:n}) \sim \mathcal{N}(x_n,h\sigma^2).
$$

The mean of this distribution is $x_n$.
Note that this also gives the distributional forecast.

### Seasonal naive method

Assume $p$ independent random walk processes $(Y_t^{(1)}),(Y_t^{(1)}), (Y_t^{(p)})$, each with $\delta = 0$.
We construct a time series model by setting $X_t = Y_{\lceil t / p \rceil}^{(t~\text{mod}~p)}$.

<!-- [^5]: Here, $t~\text{mod}~p$ is the notation used in [modular arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_arithmetic) to denote the remainder of $t$ when divided by $p$. For example, if $t = 10$ and $p=3$, $t~\text{mod}~p = 1$. -->

To forecast the value of $x_{n+h}$, we therefore first identify the index of the random walk it comes from, followed by the most recent observation from that random walk.
This turns out to be $n - ((p-h)~\text{mod}~p)$.

As with the previous example, we may recurse @eq-stationary-rw to show that
$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = x_{n - ((p-h)~\text{mod}~p)}.
$$

### Linear trend method

Assume the signal in noise model
$$
X_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1t + W_t.
$$
The relevant formulas follow from linear regression theory.

### Drift method

Assume the random walk model @eq-stationary-rw.
Recursing the equation, we get
$$
X_{n+h} = X_n + h\theta + \sum_{t=n+1}^{n+h} W_t
$$

so that the mean of the forecast distribution is

$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = x_n + h\theta.
$$

Similar to the mean method, we just have to estimate $\theta$.

We have

$$
p_\theta(x_t|x_{t-1}) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}(x_t - \theta - x_{t-1})^2\right)
$$

Multiplying these together for $t=2,3,\ldots,n)$, we get

$$
p(x_2\ldots,x_n|x_1) \propto \exp\left(-\frac{1}{2\sigma^2}\sum_{t=2}^n (x_t - x_{t-1} - \theta)^2\right)
$$

The maximizer is hence $\hat\theta = \frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{t=2}^n (x_t - x_{t-1}) = \frac{x_n - x_1}{n-1}$.

The forecast is thus

$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = x_n + h \cdot \frac{x_n-x_1}{n-1}.
$$

## Gaussian processes

### Definition

The examples in the previous section notwithstanding, it is generally difficult to compute formulas for conditional distributions in order to derive forecasts.
This is one motivation for working with Gaussian processes, which do not have this problem.

We say that $(X_t)$ is a *Gaussian process* if all finite dimensional projections $(X_{t_1},X_{t_2},\ldots,X_{t_k})$ have a multivariate normal distribution.
The distribution of a Gaussian process is fully determined by its mean and autocovariance functions.
More precisely, the density for $(X_{t_1},X_{t_2},\ldots,X_{t_k})$ is given by
$$
p(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k) = (2\pi)^{-k/2} \det(\Gamma)^{-1/2}\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}(x_{1:k} - \mu)^T\Gamma^{-1}(x_{1:k} - \mu)\right),
$$
where $x_{1:k} = (x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_k)$, $\mu = (\mu_X(t_1),\ldots,\mu_X(t_k))$, and $\Gamma_{ij} = \gamma_X(t_i, t_j)$.

If $(X_t)$ is weakly stationary, then $\mu$ is a constant vector and the entries of $\Gamma$ depend only on the differences $|t_i - t_j|$.
In particular it is strongly stationary.

### Gaussian conditional distributions {#sec-ar-gaussian}

We first discuss some properties of multivariate normal distributions.

**Proposition 10.1.** (Conditional distribution)
Let $(X_1,X_2,\ldots,X_{n+1}) \sim N(\mu, \Sigma)$ be a multivariate Gaussian random vector, then given observations $X_1=x_1, X_2 = x_2,\ldots,X_{n} = x_{n}$, the conditional distribution of $X_{n+1}$ conditioned on these values is 
$$
N(\mu_{n+1} + \Sigma_{1:n,n+1}^T\Sigma_{1:n,1:n}^{-1}(x_{1:n} - \mu_{1:n}), \Sigma_{n+1,n+1} - \Sigma_{1:n,n+1}^T\Sigma_{1:n,1:n}^{-1}\Sigma_{1:n,n+1}),
$$ {#eq-fundamentals-gaussian-conditional}
where $\Sigma_{1:n,1:n}$ is the top left $n \times n$ submatrix of $\Sigma$, $\Sigma_{n+1,n+1}$ its bottom right entry, and $\Sigma_{n+1,1:n}$ its bottom row without the bottom right entry，i.e.
$$
\Sigma = \left[\begin{matrix}     \Sigma_{1:n,1:n} & \Sigma_{1:n,n+1}  \\  \Sigma_{n+1,1:n} & \Sigma_{n+1,n+1}
\end{matrix}\right].
$$

*Proof.*
This is a [well-known property](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivariate_normal_distribution#Conditional_distributions) of multivariate Gaussian distributions and can be proved by computing the conditional density using the [block matrix inverse formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_matrix#Block_matrix_inversion).

This formula is used often in many areas of statistics (and engineering).
In the context of time series analysis, we typically assume stationarity, which means that the formula simplifies.

**Corollary 10.2.** (Conditional distribution under stationarity)
Let $(X_1,X_2,\ldots)$ be a zero mean stationary Gaussian process, then given observations $X_1=x_1, X_2 = x_2,\ldots,X_{n} = x_{n}$, the conditional distribution of $X_{n+h}$ conditioned on these values is
$$
N(\gamma_{h:n+h-1}^T\Gamma_{n}^{-1}x_{n:1}, \gamma_X(0) - \gamma_{h:n+h-1}^T\Gamma_{n}^{-1}\gamma_{h:n+h-1}),
$$ {#eq-ar-forecast-distribution}
where
$$
\gamma_{a:b} \coloneqq \left(\gamma_X(a), \gamma_X(a+1),\ldots,\gamma_X(b)\right)
$$ {#eq-ar-forecast-gamma}
for any $a < b$,
$$
\Gamma_n \coloneqq (\gamma_X(i-j))_{i,j=1}^n,
$$ {#eq-ar-forecast-Gamma}
and $x_{n:1} = (x_n, x_{n-1},\ldots,x_1)$.

Assuming Gaussian white noise, @eq-ar-forecast-distribution thus gives the distributional forecast and can be used to supply point forecasts
$$
\hat x_{n+h|n} = \gamma_{h:n+h-1}^T\Gamma_{n}^{-1}x_{n:1}
$$ {#eq-ar-forecast-mean}
as well as 95% prediction intervals $(\hat x_{n+h|n} - 1.96v_{n+h}^{1/2}, \hat x_{n+h|n} + 1.96v_{n+h}^{1/2})$ for $v_{n+h} = \gamma_X(0) - \gamma_{h:n+h-1}^T\Gamma_{n}^{-1}\gamma_{h:n+h-1}$.

### Takeaways {#sec-fundamentals-gaussian-takeaways}

Note that the conditional variance formula in @eq-ar-forecast-distribution can be interpreted as the *Bayes optimal* expected prediction error when predicting $X_{n+h}$ given observations $X_{1:n} = x_{1:n}$.
When the Gaussian process is not equivalent to white noise, the formula is strictly smaller than $\gamma_X(0)$ which is the marginal variance of $X_{n+h}$ and hence also the expected prediction error when using the mean method.
In other words, when the time series is stationary but not white noise, its past values can be used to improve predictions of future values.

In real data analysis, we are not told what the model is and have to estimate it from the data.
The formulas in this section also show that for Gaussian processes, all we really need to know for forecasting are the mean and autocovariance functions (i.e. the first and second moments of the stochastic process).
The key benefit of stationarity is that these moments can be estimated from just a single realization of the stochastic process, as we will show further in the next section.


## Moment estimation {#sec-stationary-moments}

In @sec-summarystats, we learnt about sample versions of the mean, autocovariance function, and autocorrelation function.
It turns out that when the time series is drawn from a stationary linear process, all three are consistent and asymptotically normal estimators of their population counterparts, as the length $n$ of the time series converges to infinity.
As we will soon see, this allows us to perform hypothesis testing in various scenarios.

**Theorem 10.3** (Mean).
If $(X_t)$ is a stationary linear process, then
$$
\sqrt{n}\left(\bar X_n - \mu \right) \to_d N(0, V),
$$
where
$$
V = \sum_{h = - \infty}^\infty \gamma_X(h) = \sigma^2 \left(\sum_{j=-\infty}^\infty \psi_j \right)^2.
$$
Furthermore, if $(X_t)$ is a linear process on Gaussian white noise, then we have
$$
\bar X_n \sim N\left(\mu, \frac{1}{n}\sum_{|h| < n} \left(1 - \frac{|h|}{n}\right)\gamma_X(h)\right).
$$

*Proof:* See Theorem A.5 of a proof of the first statement.
For the second, we just need to compute the variance of $\bar X$ as follows:
$$
\begin{split}
\Var\lbrace\bar X_n\rbrace & = \Var\left\lbrace \frac{1}{n}\sum_{t=1}^n X_t\right\rbrace \\
& = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{s,t=1}^n \Cov\lbrace X_s, X_t\rbrace \\
& = \frac{1}{n^2}\sum_{s,t=1}^n \gamma_X(t-s) \\
& = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{h=-n}^n \left(1 - \frac{|h|}{n} \right)\gamma_X(h).
\end{split}
$$

**Theorem 10.4** (ACF).
If $(X_t)$ is a stationary linear process based on white noise with finite 4th moments[^4], then for any fixed $k$,
$$
\sqrt{n}\left(\hat\rho_{1:k} - \rho_{1:k}\right) \to_d N(0, V),
$$
where $\rho_{1:k} = (\rho_X(1),\ldots,\rho_X(k))$, $\hat\rho_{1:k} = (\hat\rho_X(1),\ldots,\hat\rho_X(k))$, and
$$
V_{ij} = \sum_{u=1}^\infty \left(\rho(u+i) + \rho(u-i) - 2\rho(i)\rho(u)\right)\left(\rho(u+j) + \rho(u-j) - 2\rho(j)\rho(u)\right).
$$
In particular, if $(X_t)$ is white noise, then
$$
\sqrt{n}\rho_{1:k} \to_d N(0,I).
$$

*Proof:* See Theorem A.7 in @shumway2000time.

[^4]: $(W_t)$ has finite 4th moments if $\E W_t^4 < \infty$ for all $t$.

Note that the ACVF and the CCF both have similar limiting behavior. 
See Theorem A.6 and Theorem A.8 in @shumway2000time for more details.

## Applying models to data {#sec-stationary-applying-models-to-data}

Time series models are useful for several different time series tasks, such as forecasting, smoothing, regression, simulation, and anomaly detection.
Here, we focus on their use in forecasting.

The simple forecasting methods as well as exponential smoothing methods allow us to exploit trend and seasonality patterns for forecasting.
However, they are not able to make use of short-term cycles or, more generally, any patterns in the remainder component of a time series decomposition.
On the other hand, unless the remainder component comprises white noise, time-based correlations exist, and these can be used to improve forecasts, as discussed in @sec-fundamentals-gaussian-takeaways.
This is addressed by the *Box-Jenkins method*, which we now discuss.

The [Box-Jenkins method](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box%E2%80%93Jenkins_method), named after George Box and Gwilym Jenkins, was formulated in their textbook @box2015time.[^5]
It roughly involves the following steps:

[^5]: The book was first published in 1970 but has since been reprinted.

**Step 1:** Transform the time series $(X_t)$ to make it stationary using time series decomposition, differencing, and/or Box-Cox transformations.

**Step 2:** Identify the correct model to fit to the transformed time series $(Y_t)$.

**Step 3:** Fit the model and estimate the model coefficients.

**Step 4:** Check whether the residuals from Step 3 are white noise. If so, we are done. If not, return to Step 2.

**Step 5:** To forecast for $(X_t)$, first forecast for the transformed time series, then back transform the forecasts.

The Box-Jenkins method is certainly not the only approach to time series modeling and forecasting.
Nonetheless, it is quite influential and remains very useful.
It underpins our interest in modeling stationary time series.

Typically, the model fit in Step 2 is an AutoRegressive Moving Average (ARMA) model, which we will learn about in @sec-ar.
We next discuss Step 1 and Step 4 in more detail in the next two sections.


## Two types of non-stationarity

There are two common types of non-stationarity, each of which are best handled using different techniques.

**Trend stationarity:**
We say that $(X_t)$ is *trend stationary* if
$$
X_t = f_t + Y_t,
$$ {#eq-stationary-trend-stationary}
where $(f_t)$ is a deterministic sequence and $(Y_t)$ is a stationary process.
Note that, the terminology notwithstanding, $f_t$ may include trend, seasonality, as well as long-term cycles.
In this case, one can try to estimate $f_t$ and subtract it from $X_t$ in order to obtain a stationary sequence.
This is of course just time series decomposition and one can use the techniques learned in @sec-decomposition to do this.
If $f_t$ has a convenient functional form, or if it is a deterministic function of other known, concurrent time series, one can also perform [dynamic regression](https://otexts.com/fpp3/dynamic.html).

**Unit root:**
[Unit roots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_root) require some technical jargon to define.
We will defer this to @sec-arima.
For now, we note that some time series cannot be made stationary via subtracting trend and seasonal components.
For instance, the simple random walk falls into this category because it already has has mean and no seasonality.
On the other hand, it can be made stationary by taking a difference on @eq-stationary-rw:
$$
\begin{split}
Y_t & \coloneqq X_t - X_{t-1} \\
& = \delta + W_t.
\end{split}
$$
Because taking a single first difference makes the the random walk stationary, we say that it has one unit root.

Note that taking a difference of a trend stationary process with linear trend, $X_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1 t + Y_t$, can also make it stationary.
Indeed, we have
$$
X_t - X_{t-1} = \beta_1 + Y_t - Y_{t-1},
$$
and the first difference of a stationary sequence remains stationary (check this.)
More generally, when $f_t$ in @eq-stationary-trend-stationary is a degree $k$ polynomial, it can be made stationary by taking differences $k$ times.
However, it is not recommended to use differencing on trend stationary time series.
This is because taking differences leads to instability when inverting the differencing to forecast for the original time series (Step 5 of Box-Jenkins).
Recall our interpretation of differencing as discrete differentiation, this phenomenon is analogous to how small changes in derivatives $g'$, $g''$, etc. can lead to large changes in the behavior of the original function $g$.

There are various tests for stationarity and for the presence of unit roots, such as the Dickey-Fuller test and the KPSS test.
We will discuss them in further detail in @sec-arima.

These are not the only types of non-stationarity.
Consider for instance the case where we have a multiplicative time series decomposition.

## Testing for white noise {#sec-stationary-testing-white-noise}

If the residuals in Step 3 are not white noise, then we could in principle use the remaining autocorrelations to improve our forecast model.
Hence, it is important to know how to test whether the residuals are indeed white noise.

### Three tests

There are several ways of testing whether $(X_t)$ is a white noise sequence.
These tests are mostly based on the asymptotic normality of the ACF.
Note further that while the null hypothesis is that $(X_t)$ is white noise, the alternative is not clearly defined.[^6]

[^6]: Such a hypothesis test is sometimes called a [portmanteau test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portmanteau_test), although the there seems to be some confusion about the meaning of the term in the literature.

**Visual "test":**
We can inspect the ACF plot.
Note that in an ACF plot generated using `ACF() |> autoplot()`, the dotted blue horizontal lines are positioned at $\pm 1.96/\sqrt{n}$.
Under the null hypothesis that $(X_t)$ is white noise, then by the second theorem in @sec-stationary-moments, the spikes should be approximately i.i.d. Gaussian, with variance $1/n$, which means that each spike should not exceed these lines with 95% probability.

**Box-Pierce test:**
Define the Box-Pierce test statistic:
$$
Q_{BP} \coloneqq n\sum_{j=1}^h \hat\rho_X(j)^2.
$$
By the [continuous mapping theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_mapping_theorem), we have $Q_{BP} \to_d \chi^2_{h}$ under the null hypothesis.
In other words, in converges in distribution to a chi-squared distribution with $h$ degrees of freedom.
The Box-Pierce test thus rejects $H_0$ when $Q_{BP}$ is larger than the $1-\alpha$ quantile of $\chi^2_h$.
Alternatively, if we let $F$ denote the quantile function of $\chi^2_h$, we obtain a p-value via computing $1 - F(Q_{BP})$.

**Ljung-Box test**
Define the Ljung-Box test statistic:
$$
Q_{LB} \coloneqq n(n+2)\sum_{j=1}^h \frac{\hat\rho_X(j)^2}{n-j}
$$ {#eq-stationary-ljungbox}
Asymptotically, we also have $Q_{LB} \to_d \chi^2_{h}$ under the null hypothesis, and one can use $Q_{LB}$ in exactly the same would you would use $Q_{BP}$.
On the other hand, it has been found that the distribution of $Q_{LB}$ is closer to $\chi^2_{h}$ than that of $Q_{BP}$ in finite samples.
Hence, the Ljung-Box test is usually preferred to the Box-Pierce test.

Note that both the Box-Pierce test and the Ljung-Box test come with a tuning parameter: $h$.
Hence, each actually comprises a family of hypothesis tests.
There does not seem to be an established best practice on how to pick $h$.
@hyndman2018forecasting recommend setting $h = \min\lbrace 10, n/5\rbrace$ for non-seasonal data, and $h = \min\lbrace 2p, n/5\rbrace$ for seasonal data, where $p$ is the period of the seasonality.
Here, the logic is that $h$ should be large enough so that it can include any troublesome ACF values, but not too large as in that case, the test statistic may be quite different from the reference $\chi^2_h$ distribution.[^7]

Note also that if the time series to be tested, $(X_t)$, comprises the residuals of a fitted model with $r$ parameters, then $Q_{LB}$ and $Q_{BP}$ actually converge to $\chi^2_{h-r}$, which tends to have smaller values.
Hence, we can obtain a more powerful test by comparing their values with the quantiles of this reference distribution.

::: {.callout-note}
There are also a number of other tests that can be used, such as the [Breusch-Godfrey test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breusch%E2%80%93Godfrey_test) or the difference-sign test.
We refer the interested reader to Chapter 1.6 of @brockwell1991time.

### Example 1: Apple stock

We now try to model Apple daily closing stock prices in 2015.
We first create and plot the data as follows:

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Apple daily closing stock price in 2015.
#| label: fig-stationary-apple
apple_2015 <- gafa_stock |> 
    filter(Symbol == "AAPL") |> 
    filter(year(Date) == 2015) |> 
    mutate(trading_day = row_number()) |> # <1>
    as_tsibble(index = trading_day, regular = TRUE) # <1>

apple_2015 |>
    autoplot(Close)
```

1. We create a new index column because the stock market is closed on weekends and holidays.

From the above plot, we see that the stock price seems to be similar to a random walk, so we try to model it using the naive method.
We then apply the "visual" test to the residuals $x_t - x_{t-1}$.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Residual diagnostics for the naive method applied to Apple daily closing stock price in 2015.
#| label: fig-stationary-apple-2
apple_fit <- apple_2015 |> 
    model(Naive = NAIVE(Close))
    
apple_fit |> 
    gg_tsresiduals()
```

Here, the function `gg_tsresiduals()` has automatically generated three plots for the residuals of the model:

1. (Top) A time plot
2. (Bottom left) An ACF plot
3. (Bottom right) A histogram

Outside of some outlier values around day 150, the rest of the values seem to be drawn from an i.i.d. Gaussian distribution.
We can check this further using the Ljung-Box test.
Below, we first create a table containing the residuals using the function `augment()`.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
apple_fit |>
    augment()
```

Note that there are two types of residuals in this table.
The column labeled `.resid` comprises the residuals $x_t - \hat x_{t|t-1}$.
The column labeled `.innov` comprises the *innovation residuals*.
These are the residuals of the transformed time series if a transformation was performed on the time series prior to forecasting, and are equal to the regular residuals if no transformation was performed.

We now perform Ljung-Box on the innovation residuals.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
apple_fit |>
    augment() |>
    features(.innov, ljung_box, lag = 10)
```

Here, we see that the p-value is much larger than 0.05, so we do not reject the null hypothesis that the residuals are white noise.
In other words, the random walk model / naive method seems to have a good fit to the data.

### Example 2: Tourist arrivals to Australia

Recall our use of classical decomposition to model tourist arrivals to Australia from the UK (@sec-decomposition-examples).
Let us now check whether the remainder component of the decomposition are white noise.
We first generate this time series as follows.

```{r}
arrivals_ausjap_remainder <- aus_arrivals |>
    filter(Origin == "UK") |>
    model(
        classical_decomposition(Arrivals, type = "multiplicative")
        ) |>
    components() |>
    select(Quarter, random)
```

Next, we make time and ACF plots.

::: panel-tabset

## Time plot

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: Remainder component of a classical decomposition of tourist arrivals to Australia from the UK.
#| label: fig-stationary-arrivals-time
arrivals_ausjap_remainder |>
    autoplot(random)
```

## ACF plot

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
#| fig-cap: ACF of remainder component of a classical decomposition of tourist arrivals to Australia from the UK.
#| label: fig-stationary-arrivals-acf
arrivals_ausjap_remainder |>
    ACF(random) |>
    autoplot()
```

:::

From the ACF plot, we see that there are a number of spikes that lie outside of the confidence band for white noise.
Finally, we compute the p-value for the Ljung-Box test at lag $h = 4 * 2 = 8$.
This is very small, confirming our suspicions that the remainder component is significantly different from white noise.

```{r}
#| warning: FALSE
#| message: FALSE
arrivals_ausjap_remainder |>
    features(random, ljung_box, lag = 8)
```
